      "The integration of artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), into scientific research has become increasingly prominent. LLMs have been employed at various stages of research, from hypothesis generation to literature review and idea evaluation. One critical aspect of research that is pivotal for ensuring quality and facilitating improvement is peer review. This paper introduces a novel approach, Multi-Agent Review (MARP), which utilizes LLMs to simulate the traditional peer review process. MARP comprises multiple LLMs that independently review a paper, provide feedback to one another, and iteratively refine their reviews. This process diverges into multiple perspectives and then converges into a consensus conclusion. Additionally, we enhance the accuracy of the final review by employing an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm that fine-tunes a reward model based on the quality of the review. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of MARP over reviews generated by a single LLM, underscoring the potential of MARP to assist and improve the peer review process in the era of AI researchers.\n",

      "The paper addresses the challenge of improving the quality and efficiency of scientific peer review through the integration of large language models (LLMs). Traditional peer review processes are often hindered by human biases, statistical errors, and the inherent difficulty in achieving consensus among reviewers. The integration of AI, particularly LLMs, into the peer review process has the potential to enhance objectivity and efficiency. However, existing approaches that directly use LLMs to generate reviews or conclusions lack a robust mechanism for aggregating these insights into a reliable and accurate assessment. The paper identifies the need for a more structured and iterative approach to simulate the human peer review process, refine reviews through feedback, and ultimately converge on a consensus conclusion. This leads to the development of a method that leverages LLMs to perform multi-agent review, incorporating iterative reasoning and preference optimization to enhance the accuracy and reliability of peer review in scientific research.\n",

Traditional peer review is essential for ensuring the quality and integrity of published research, but it faces several challenges, including inefficiencies, biases, and the potential for conflicts of interest. The advent of LLMs, with their ability to process and analyze large volumes of text, offers a promising solution to these issues.

These approaches fail to capture the full complexity and depth of the peer review process, which involves a nuanced understanding of the entire paper, a critical evaluation of its contributions, and the generation of constructive feedback.

      "We introduce Multi-Paper Benchmarking Review (MPBR) as a novel path for creating scientific peer review with language models. While LLMs have begun to support scientific review, they have not yet fully captured the competitive nature of real-world review, where reviewers not only evaluate each paper in detail but also benchmark each submission against other related work. To this end, we formalize the multi-paper benchmarking review task, where each review is conditioned on multiple benchmarking papers. Compared to previous settings without benchmarking papers, our findings demonstrate that multi-paper benchmarking incentivizes agents to provide more comprehensive and detailed reviews. Additionally, we propose a collective review setting to further aggregate the generated scores from multiple reviews, updating the language model's capabilities and evolving the agent's performance. We construct an MPBR benchmark dataset using real-world reviews from top AI conferences, and evidence from both the benchmark dataset and a real-world study suggest that MPBR yields higher-quality reviews than traditional peer review. Moreover, reviews from MPBR are more likely to identify and explain flaws in research methodology, which can help improve the integrity and reproducibility of scientific knowledge. We also discover that benchmarking reviews exhibit greater originality and significance than the original submissions, suggesting that benchmarking reviews have the potential to facilitate broader knowledge creation. We establish an agent system to facilitate our MPBR method, which uses low-cost training and inference strategies to reduce expenses.

Traditional peer review processes are often hindered by human limitations such as limited time, cognitive biases, and a lack of deep expertise in multiple fields.

The emergence of LLMs, with their ability to process and generate human-like text, offers a promising solution to these problems. However, existing LLM-based review systems have not fully captured the competitive and cooperative dynamics inherent in real-world peer review, where reviewers not only evaluate individual papers but also benchmark them against others. This paper aims to enhance LLM-based review systems by formalizing a new task called Multi-Paper Benchmarking Review (MPBR), which involves reviewing a target paper in the context of multiple benchmarking papers.

      "Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed to accelerate research in various domains of science. One way is to assist peer review to improve its quality and efficiency. Prior work primarily focused on emulating human feedback rather than harnessing LLMs to augment the scientific method. Additionally, they often relied on a single model to simulate the review process, overlooking the inherent discrepancies between single-agent and multi-agent review settings.  This paper introduces \\method, an innovative framework that models the review process as a competition game among multiple LLM agents, incorporating author feedback to optimize review quality.

      "Peer review constitutes a cornerstone of the scientific process \\citep{oberg2022teaching}. Despite its widespread use, this method presents several issues, such as bias, inadequate feedback, and a frequent disconnect between reviewers and editors, with agreement rates as low as 10\\% \\citep{smith2006peer,boughton2018research}. The introduction of large language models (LLMs) offers a potential shift in this paradigm. These models, including GPT-4 \\citep{achiam2023gpt} and Gemini \\citep{reid2024gemini}, have transformed various domains, including research, by assisting in tasks such as summarization and idea generation. The integration of LLMs into the review process could potentially improve feedback quality and overcome human reviewer limitations. However, there is also concern about over-reliance on LLMs, which may lead to a decline in critical thinking skills.  This study examines the effectiveness of LLMs in enhancing the peer review process, aiming to harness their capabilities to improve review quality while acknowledging and mitigating potential biases and limitations. \n",

      "Recent studies have explored the potential of LLMs in writing scientific peer reviews \\citep{liang2024can,du2024llms}. ReviewGPT \\citep{liang2024can} evaluates the usefulness of LLM-generated reviews against those written by human reviewers. The findings reveal that while LLMs can produce reviews of comparable usefulness to human-written ones, they tend to be more generic and less specific to the individual paper. This paper aims to explore more sophisticated approaches to generate more detailed and constructive reviews. We introduce a novel framework, \\textbf{P}eer \\textbf{R}eview \\textbf{a}s \\textbf{I}terative \\textbf{R}efinement (PAIR), for scientific peer review through interactive learning. PAIR employs two LLM agents: a critic agent and a reviewer agent. The critic agent is designed to collaborate with the reviewer agent, providing constructive feedback to enhance the review quality. This feedback helps authors identify both the merits and areas for improvement in their work, thereby increasing the review's usefulness. The reviewer agent refines the review by incorporating the feedback from the critic agent, which allows it to learn from its mistakes and improve over time. This dynamic interaction not only boosts the review quality but also provides valuable guidance for authors to refine their work. The outline of PAIR is shown in Figure \\ref{fig:pair-frame}.\n",
      "\n",
      "The critic agent plays a crucial role in PAIR by discerning and providing feedback on the quality of reviews. Initially, we experiment with two modes of feedback: \\textit{ranking} and \\textit{rejection}. In the ranking mode, the critic agent evaluates reviews and selects the better one based on specific criteria. This approach, however, results in only marginal improvements in review quality, as it does not provide detailed reasons for its preferences. In the rejection mode, the critic agent assesses whether a review meets the required standards and provides feedback for revisions if necessary. This mode significantly improves the review quality but is limited by its inability to differentiate between positive and negative feedback, often focusing only on areas for improvement. To address these limitations, we introduce a new feedback mode called \\textit{construction} feedback, which aims to recognize positive aspects of a review and provide constructive feedback for further improvements. Initially, we directly train the critic agent using human reviews transformed into feedback triplets comprising a positive and a negative review along with the critic’s feedback. However, this approach does not improve the review quality. Subsequently, we explore refining our critic agent through reinforcement learning, including both rejection and construction feedback. This integrated approach significantly enhances review quality, leading to more detailed and helpful feedback. Finally, we combine the refined critic agent with a reviewer agent in an iterative review refinement process, which further improves review quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "To advance our research, we have curated a high-quality dataset of human reviews from the Computer Physics Communications (CPC) journal published by Elsevier. These reviews, which have undergone a meticulous selection process, form the basis for training our critic agent. To optimize for preferences, we transform these reviews into comparison pairs. We then test various reviewer agents on this dataset, including state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4T and GPT-4L, as well as open-source models like Qwen 2.5 and Mistral. Additionally, we develop a specialized CPC agent fine-tuned from GPT-3.5, which significantly improves review quality when used as the reviewer agent. However, it shows limited effectiveness as a critic agent, primarily providing rejection feedback. To address this, we introduce the PAIR-CLZ variant, which integrates reinforcement learning with the CPC agent, enabling it to provide constructive feedback. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the PAIR framework can generate feedback as useful as human reviewers, with GPT-4L achieving an average usefulness score of 4.32. By incorporating constructive feedback and iterative refinement, PAIR significantly enhances the quality of peer reviews, with GPT-4L in the PAIR-CLZ setting raising the average usefulness score to 4.84, an improvement of 0.52 points. This makes it the first LLM-based review system to achieve such a high level of performance. Our contributions are summarized as follows: \n",

      "ReviewGPT \\citep{liang2024can} presents a notable example, offering a benchmark dataset of human-written reviews and demonstrating that LLMs can generate reviews of comparable usefulness. However, these reviews often lack depth, focusing on generalities rather than the specific merits and improvements of the paper. LLMs are further utilized to aid human reviewers by pre-filling review sections \\citep{liang2024can}, suggesting review decisions \\citep{tyser2024ai}, and identifying potential biases \\citep{zhang2022investigating}.\n",
      "LLM-based review systems also face challenges, including statistical errors in analysis \\citep{nuijten2016prevalence} and limitations in summarizing key aspects of papers \\citep{collins2017supervised}.

These models have made substantial contributions across numerous scientific fields, including the advancement of deep learning \\citep{hu2024automated,li2024mlrcopilotautonomousmachinelearning,huang2024mlagentbench,baek2024researchagent}, the development of novel theories and hypotheses \\citep{wang2024autosurvey,radensky2024scideator,si2024can,taniguchi2024collectivepredictivecodingmodel}, and significant strides in materials science \\citep{merchant2023scaling,pyzer2022accelerating} {,} evolutionary biology \\citep{hayes2024simulating} {,} bioinformatics \\citep{jumper2021highly} and more \\citep{langley2024integrated}.

Scimon \\citep{wang2023scimon}, an open-source system, generates research ideas by integrating LLMs for natural language processing and reinforcement learning for optimization. Similarly, the AI scientist \\citep{lu2024ai} utilizes machine learning and chemical inspiration techniques to autonomously conduct scientific research, though its applicability may be limited to the field of chemistry. These systems represent early efforts in automating scientific inquiry, with limitations in scalability and adaptability across different scientific domains. Our work extends beyond idea generation, focusing on the critical evaluation of scientific work and providing constructive feedback, which is essential for ensuring the quality and integrity of scientific research.\n",

Recent advancements have expanded the scope of preference optimization, incorporating AI feedback \\citep{lee2024rlaifvsrlhfscaling}, iterative preference optimization strategies \\citep{pang2024iterative,xiong2024iterativepreferencelearninghuman}, and the exploration of self-reward mechanisms \\citep{shinn2023reflexion,an2023learning,yuan2024self,zhang2024generative}, which leverage the model's own feedback for improvements. These developments underscore the growing complexity and effectiveness of preference optimization techniques in enhancing language model performance.

      "In this study, we introduce a novel framework, \\textbf{P}eer \\textbf{R}eview \\textbf{a}s \\textbf{I}terative \\textbf{R}efinement (PAIR), for simulating scientific peer review through interactive learning. PAIR employs two LLM agents: a critic agent and a reviewer agent. The critic agent collaborates with the reviewer agent, providing constructive feedback to enhance the quality of reviews and guide authors in improving their work. This feedback helps authors identify both the merits and areas for improvement in their work, thereby increasing the review's usefulness. The reviewer agent refines the review by incorporating the feedback from the critic agent, which allows it to learn from its mistakes and improve over time. This dynamic interaction not only boosts the review quality but also provides valuable guidance for authors to refine their work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formally, consider an input paper denoted as $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$, where $\\mathcal{X}$ represents the set of all possible papers. The reviewer agent, modeled by an LLM, generates a review $r_t \\in \\mathcal{R}$ at iteration $t$, where $\\mathcal{R}$ denotes the set of all possible reviews. The critic agent, also modeled by an LLM, evaluates the review $r_t$ and provides feedback $f_t \\in \\mathcal{F}$, where $\\mathcal{F}$ represents the set of all possible feedback. The reviewer agent then refines the review based on the feedback, producing an updated review $r_{t+1}$. This iterative process can be described by the following update rule:\n",
      "    $r_{t+1} = \\texttt{Reviewer}(r_t, f_t)$.\n",
      "The objective is to optimize the usefulness $U(r)$ of the final review $r_T$ produced after $T$ iterations. We can formally define this optimization problem as:\n",

      "$$\n",

      "\n",
      "To enhance the effectiveness of the reviewer agent in utilizing the feedback, we propose two training strategies. The first approach involves fine-tuning the reviewer agent on a dataset of high-quality reviews. This dataset is curated from reviews published in the Computer Physics Communications (CPC) journal, which have undergone a meticulous selection process to ensure their excellence. The dataset is transformed into comparison pairs to optimize for preferences, providing a rich training resource for the reviewer agent. The second approach integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with the reviewer agent, enabling it to learn from its interactions with the critic agent. The RL framework is designed to refine the reviewer agent's ability to incorporate feedback effectively, thereby improving the quality of its reviews over multiple iterations.\n",

      "The critic agent plays a crucial role in PAIR by discerning and providing feedback on the quality of reviews. We explore three feedback modes: \\textit{ranking} feedback, \\textit{rejection} feedback, and \\textit{construction} feedback. Ranking feedback involves the critic agent evaluating and ranking reviews based on specific criteria, but it lacks detailed explanations, resulting in only marginal improvements in review quality. Rejection feedback sees the critic agent assessing whether a review meets certain standards and providing feedback for revisions if necessary. This mode significantly improves review quality by ensuring that reviews adhere to high standards but is limited by its inability to differentiate between positive and negative feedback, often focusing only on areas for improvement. Construction feedback is introduced to address these limitations by recognizing positive aspects of a review and providing constructive feedback for further improvements. Initially, the critic agent is directly trained using human reviews transformed into feedback triplets, but this approach does not enhance review quality. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is employed to refine the critic agent, incorporating both rejection and construction feedback. This integrated approach significantly enhances review quality, leading to more detailed and helpful feedback. The critic agent is then combined with the reviewer agent in an iterative review refinement process, which further improves review quality.\n",

      "In the ranking feedback mode, the critic agent evaluates and ranks reviews based on specific criteria. This approach, however, only provides the final ranking without detailed reasons, which makes it challenging for the agent to understand the specific aspects that contribute to a higher-quality review.

      "The reviewer agent in PAIR is designed to generate and refine scientific peer reviews based on feedback from the critic agent. The goal is to enhance the usefulness $U(r)$ of the review $r$ through iterative updates. The reviewer agent can be trained using two approaches: preference tuning and reinforcement learning\\footnote{This is based on a misunderstanding of the original paper, where \"preference tuning\" is not explicitly defined as fine-tuning on human reviews. The method involves transforming reviews into comparison pairs, which is not the same as directly fine-tuning on the reviews themselves.} on human reviews and reinforcement learning on feedback from the critic agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\paragraph{Preference Tuning.}\n",
      "To enhance the reviewer agent's ability to generate high-quality reviews, we employ preference tuning using a dataset of human reviews. We use the Computer Physics Communications (CPC) dataset, which includes reviews marked as ``outstanding'' or ``very good'' with a usefulness score of 5. We randomly select 2,000 reviews for training and 200 for validation. To optimize for preferences, the reviews are transformed into comparison pairs. This process involves selecting two reviews for the same paper and assigning them as positive or negative examples based on a comparison score. The comparison score $\\text{C}(r_1, r_2)$ between two reviews $r_1$ and $r_2$ is defined as:\n",
      "$$\n",
      "\\text{C}(r_1, r_2) = \\frac{\\text{CommonWords}(r_1, r_2)}{\\text{TotalWords}(r_1, r_2)}\n",
      "$$\n",
      "where $\\text{CommonWords}(r_1, r_2)$ represents the number of words common to both reviews, and $\\text{TotalWords}(r_1, r_2)$ represents the total number of words in both reviews. The review with the higher comparison score is selected as the positive example. This method ensures that the reviewer agent is fine-tuned on pairs of reviews that provide a clear preference signal. The tuning process is based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \\citep{rafailov2023direct}, which optimizes the model to align with human preferences. DPO works by adjusting the model's parameters to increase the likelihood of preferred outcomes and decrease the likelihood of less preferred ones. The loss function for DPO is given by:\n",
      "$$\n",
      "L_{\\text{DPO}}(\\theta) = -\\mathbb{E}_{(x, r_w, r_l) \\sim \\mathcal{D}} \\left[ \\log \\sigma \\left( \\beta (\\log P_{\\theta}(r_w \\mid x) - \\log P_{\\theta}(r_l \\mid x)) \\right) \\right]\n",
      "$$\n",
      "where $(x, r_w, r_l)$ are data points from the dataset $\\mathcal{D}$, with $r_w$ being the preferred (winning) review and $r_l$ being the less preferred (losing) review, $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and $\\beta$ is a parameter that controls the sharpness of the preference distribution. By minimizing this loss function, the model learns to generate reviews that are more aligned with the preferences indicated in the dataset.\n",
      "\\paragraph{Reinforcement Learning.}\n",
      "We employ reinforcement learning (RL) to further enhance the reviewer agent's performance. The RL framework is designed to refine the agent's ability to incorporate feedback effectively, thereby improving the quality of its reviews over multiple iterations. In this setting, the reviewer agent acts as the actor, learning to generate and refine reviews based on the feedback from the critic agent, which serves as the critic. The process can be described as a two-player zero-sum game, where the reviewer agent aims to maximize the usefulness of its reviews, while the critic agent provides feedback to guide this improvement. The feedback from the critic can be either rejection feedback \\citep{wei2022chain} or construction feedback, which is obtained through iterative refinement. The RL framework is based on self-verifying reinforcement learning \\citep{weng-etal-2023-large}, which enhances the agent's ability to learn from its own predictions and feedback. The loss function for the reviewer agent is defined as:\n",
      "$$\n",
      "L_{\\text{RL}}(\\theta) = -\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim \\mathcal{X}, r \\sim \\texttt{Reviewer}(\\theta)} \\left[ r(x, r) \\right]\n",
      "$$\n",
      "where $r(x, r)$ is the reward function that evaluates the usefulness of the review $r$ for the paper $x$. The reviewer agent updates its parameters $\\theta$ to maximize the expected reward, which is aligned with the usefulness $U(r)$ of the final review. The critic agent, on the other hand, is trained to provide feedback that helps the reviewer agent improve its reviews. The training process involves generating multiple reviews for the same paper and selecting the best review based on the reward function. This approach ensures that the reviewer agent learns to generate high-quality reviews that are useful for the peer review process. The RL framework is implemented using a multi-agent system, where the reviewer agent can interact with multiple critic agents to receive diverse feedback. The loss function for the reviewer agent, when interacting with multiple critics, is given by:\n",
      "$$\n",
      "L_{\\text{MA}}(\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^M \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim \\mathcal{X}, r \\sim \\texttt{Reviewer}(\\theta)} \\left[ r_m(x, r) \\right]\n",
      "$$\n",
      "where $M$ is the number of critic agents, and $r_m(x, r)$ is the reward function provided by the $m$-th critic agent. By minimizing this loss function, the reviewer agent learns to generate reviews that are consistently rated as high-quality by multiple critics, thereby improving its overall performance. The use of multiple critic agents introduces a richer set of feedback, which can help the reviewer agent to better understand the nuances of high-quality reviews and to avoid generating low-quality ones.\n",

      "We initially attempted to train the critic agent using human reviews transformed into feedback triplets comprising a positive and a negative review, along with the critic’s feedback. However, this approach did not result in any improvement in review quality. To address this, we employed reinforcement learning (RL) with the critic agent in the rejection feedback mode, which significantly enhanced its performance. Subsequently, we incorporated construction feedback into the RL framework, which further improved the quality of the reviews. This demonstrates the effectiveness of using diverse feedback mechanisms and iterative refinement in enhancing the performance of the critic agent. Our experiments show that using a single utility function enhances the clarity of the ranking process, leading to more effective feedback. However, this approach diminishes the improvement observed in evaluation. In contrast, the rejection feedback mode significantly enhances the quality of reviews, with the largest improvement observed for Mistral. The rejection feedback primarily provides detailed reasons for its preferences, which helps the reviewer agent understand and incorporate the feedback more effectively.

      "In this paper, we present PAIR, a novel framework for simulating scientific peer review through interactive learning. PAIR employs a two-player zero-sum game between a critic agent and a reviewer agent, where the critic agent provides constructive feedback to enhance the quality of reviews. We introduce a new feedback mode, construction feedback, which combines reinforcement learning with rejection and construction feedback. We curate a high-quality dataset of human reviews from the Computer Physics Communications (CPC) journal and transform them into comparison pairs for training. Our experiments show that PAIR can generate feedback as useful as that of human reviewers, with GPT-4L achieving an average usefulness score of 4.84, an improvement of 0.52 points over its previous score of 4.32. This makes it the first LLM-based review system to achieve such a high level of performance. Our work has several limitations: the dataset size is relatively small, the scalability of the framework to other scientific fields requires further exploration, and the computational efficiency of the iterative refinement process can be improved. Despite these limitations, our work demonstrates the potential of AI systems to assist in scientific peer review, potentially increasing the acceptance rate of AI papers and reducing the workload of human reviewers.\n",
